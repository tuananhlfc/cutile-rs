# Contributing to cuTile Rust

Thank you for your interest in contributing to cuTile Rust! Based on the type of contribution, it will fall into two categories:

1. You want to report a bug, feature request, or documentation issue:
   - File an [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutile-rs/issues/new/choose) describing what you encountered or what you want to see changed.
   - For bug reports, please include the following information:
     - Your OS (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04)
     - Your GPU and GPU architecture (e.g., NVIDIA A100, sm_80)
     - The error you're seeing (full error message / stack trace)
     - A minimal example to reproduce the error (if possible)
2. You want to implement a feature, improvement, or bug fix:
   - At this time we do not accept code contributions to the `cuda-bindings` crate.
   - For all other crates, please ensure that your commits are signed [following GitHub’s instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).
     - Before marking your PR as ready for review, please make sure all tests pass and all examples are running via `bash scripts/run_all.sh`.

# Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
