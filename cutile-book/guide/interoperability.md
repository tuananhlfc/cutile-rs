# Interoperability

The tile model handles dense tensor algebra well — GEMM, element-wise operations, reductions, convolutions — but some algorithms depend on **warp-level primitives** (`__shfl_sync`, `__ballot_sync`, `__reduce_sync`) for things like custom scan/prefix-sum, cooperative groups, or irregular data access patterns. For these, write the kernel in CUDA C++ and integrate it using the approach below.

A custom CUDA kernel can participate in the same `DeviceOperation` execution model as your tile kernels — sharing streams, chaining with `.and_then()`, and avoiding unnecessary synchronization.

## Step 1: Compile Your CUDA Kernel

Compile your CUDA C++ kernel to PTX (portable) or a `.cubin` (architecture-specific):

```bash
# PTX — portable across GPU architectures, JIT-compiled at load time.
nvcc -ptx -arch=compute_80 my_kernel.cu -o my_kernel.ptx

# cubin — pre-compiled for a single architecture, no JIT overhead.
nvcc -cubin -arch=sm_80 my_kernel.cu -o my_kernel.cubin
```

> **Architecture portability:** A `.cubin` file only runs on the exact SM architecture it was compiled for. Code compiled with `-arch=sm_80` will not load on an `sm_100` GPU. PTX avoids this problem — the CUDA driver JIT-compiles it for the target GPU at load time, at the cost of a one-time compilation delay. Prefer PTX unless you need to eliminate JIT overhead. If you must ship `.cubin` files, compile for each target architecture.

## Step 2: Load the Module and Function

Use `cuda-async`'s module loading functions to load the compiled kernel:

```rust
use cuda_async::device_context::load_module_from_file;

let module = load_module_from_file("my_kernel.cubin", device_id)?;
let function = Arc::new(module.load_function("my_kernel_entry")?);
```

For PTX (JIT-compiled at runtime):

```rust
use cuda_async::device_context::load_module_from_ptx;

let ptx_src = include_str!("my_kernel.ptx");
let module = load_module_from_ptx(ptx_src, device_id)?;
let function = Arc::new(module.load_function("my_kernel_entry")?);
```

## Step 3: Launch via AsyncKernelLaunch

`AsyncKernelLaunch` is a `DeviceOperation` that wraps the CUDA driver's kernel launch API:

```rust
use cuda_async::launch::AsyncKernelLaunch;
use cuda_core::LaunchConfig;

let mut launcher = AsyncKernelLaunch::new(function.clone());
launcher.push_arg(num_elements as u32);
launcher.push_arg(scale);
// SAFETY: input and output are valid device allocations with at least
// num_elements f32 elements. output is exclusively written; input is
// read-only. Both remain allocated until this operation completes.
unsafe {
    launcher
        .push_device_ptr(input.cu_deviceptr())
        .push_device_ptr(output.cu_deviceptr());
}
launcher.set_launch_config(LaunchConfig {
    grid_dim: ((num_elements as u32 + 255) / 256, 1, 1),
    block_dim: (256, 1, 1),
    shared_mem_bytes: 0,
});

// Execute as a DeviceOperation — integrates with the async model.
launcher.await?;
```

Scalar arguments (types implementing `DType`) can be pushed safely with `push_arg`. Device pointers must use `unsafe { push_device_ptr() }` — see [Safety: Device Pointer Arguments](#safety-device-pointer-arguments) below.

## Safety: Device Pointer Arguments

`push_device_ptr` passes a raw address to the CUDA driver. The Rust compiler has no visibility into GPU kernel code and cannot verify that:

- The pointer refers to a valid device memory allocation on the correct GPU.
- The allocation is large enough for the kernel's access pattern.
- No other operation is concurrently reading or writing the same memory.
- The argument order and types match the kernel's parameter signature.

Neither the Rust compiler nor the CUDA driver validates these invariants — mistakes result in silent undefined behavior or hard-to-diagnose GPU faults. You must verify them manually.

Scalar arguments (like `num_elements as u32`) are copied into the kernel's parameter space — the kernel reads the value, not an address. Any type implementing `DType` can be pushed safely with `push_arg`.

To prevent data races, use stream ordering: operations chained with `.and_then()` on the same stream execute in order and see each other's writes. Operations on different streams require explicit synchronization.

> **Why generated cuTile Rust kernels don't require `unsafe`:** When you write a tile kernel with `#[cutile::entry]`, the generated launcher uses the `KernelArgument` and `ArcKernelArgument` implementations for `Tensor<T>` and `Partition<Tensor<T>>`. These implementations call `push_device_ptr` internally, but can do so safely because the framework controls both sides: device pointers come from framework-managed allocations (guaranteed valid), and the ownership model — `Partition` for exclusive access, `Arc<Tensor>` for shared reads — prevents aliasing at the type level. Custom kernels bypass this: you are pushing pointers that the framework didn't allocate and can't track, so the safety burden falls on you.

You can wrap a custom kernel launch in a struct that implements `DeviceOperation`. The struct's typed fields enforce the correct argument signature, and `unsafe` is confined to `execute`:

```rust
use cuda_async::device_context::with_default_device_policy;
use cuda_async::device_future::DeviceFuture;
use cuda_async::device_operation::{DeviceOperation, ExecutionContext};
use cuda_async::error::DeviceError;
use cuda_async::launch::AsyncKernelLaunch;
use cuda_async::scheduling_policies::SchedulingPolicy;
use cuda_core::{CudaFunction, LaunchConfig};
use std::future::IntoFuture;

pub struct ScaleKernel {
    function: Arc<CudaFunction>,
    n: u32,
    scale: f32,
    input: Arc<Tensor<f32>>,
    output: Tensor<f32>,
}

impl DeviceOperation for ScaleKernel {
    type Output = (Arc<Tensor<f32>>, Tensor<f32>);

    // execute is unsafe because it enqueues async GPU work without
    // synchronizing — the returned tensors may still be in-flight.
    // Callers must synchronize (e.g. via DeviceFuture) before accessing
    // the output.
    unsafe fn execute(
        self,
        ctx: &ExecutionContext,
    ) -> Result<<Self as DeviceOperation>::Output, DeviceError> {
        let mut launcher = AsyncKernelLaunch::new(self.function);
        launcher.push_arg(self.n);
        launcher.push_arg(self.scale);
        // SAFETY: input and output are framework-managed Tensor allocations.
        // input is shared (Arc, read-only); output is exclusively written.
        unsafe {
            launcher
                .push_device_ptr(self.input.cu_deviceptr())
                .push_device_ptr(self.output.cu_deviceptr());
        }
        launcher.set_launch_config(LaunchConfig {
            grid_dim: ((self.n + 255) / 256, 1, 1),
            block_dim: (256, 1, 1),
            shared_mem_bytes: 0,
        });
        unsafe { launcher.execute(ctx)? };
        Ok((self.input, self.output))
    }
}

// IntoFuture is a supertrait of DeviceOperation. Every custom DeviceOperation
// needs this boilerplate to enable `.await` and `.sync()`.
impl IntoFuture for ScaleKernel {
    type Output = Result<(Arc<Tensor<f32>>, Tensor<f32>), DeviceError>;
    type IntoFuture = DeviceFuture<(Arc<Tensor<f32>>, Tensor<f32>), ScaleKernel>;
    fn into_future(self) -> Self::IntoFuture {
        match with_default_device_policy(|policy| policy.schedule(self)) {
            Ok(Ok(future)) => future,
            Ok(Err(e)) | Err(e) => DeviceFuture::failed(e),
        }
    }
}
```

This is the same pattern the `#[cutile::entry]` macro uses to generate safe launchers for tile kernels. No `unsafe` at the call site.

## Step 4: Compose with Tile Kernels

`AsyncKernelLaunch` implements `DeviceOperation`, so it chains with tile kernels. This pipeline runs a tile add (`z = x + y`), then the custom scale wrapper (`w = scale * z`):

```rust
// Run the tile add kernel — z = x + y.
let (z_part, _x, _y) =
    tile_add::add(z.partition([tile_size]), x.clone(), y.clone()).await?;
let z: Tensor<f32> = z_part.unpartition();

// Run the custom scale kernel — w = scale * z.
let w: Tensor<f32> = zeros::<1, f32>([num_elements]).await?;
let (_z, w) = ScaleKernel {
    function: scale_function,
    n: num_elements as u32,
    scale,
    input: Arc::new(z),
    output: w,
}
.await?;
```

## Using `with_context` for Low-Level Control

For more direct control, use `with_context` to access the CUDA stream and issue driver API calls directly:

```rust
use cuda_async::device_operation::{with_context, value, DeviceOperation};
use cuda_async::device_operation::ExecutionContext;
use cuda_core::{malloc_async, memcpy_htod_async, free_async};

let host_data: Vec<f32> = vec![1.0; num_elements];
let num_bytes = num_elements * std::mem::size_of::<f32>();

// host_data is captured by reference — it must outlive the await so that
// the async memcpy can read from it until the stream synchronizes.
let op = with_context(|ctx: &ExecutionContext| {
    let stream = ctx.get_cuda_stream();

    let dptr = unsafe {
        let dptr = malloc_async(num_bytes, stream);
        memcpy_htod_async(dptr, host_data.as_ptr(), num_elements, stream);
        dptr
    };

    value(dptr)
});

let dptr = op.await?;
// host_data is safe to drop now — the await synchronized the stream.

// Clean up: free the device memory on a stream.
with_context(move |ctx: &ExecutionContext| {
    unsafe { free_async(dptr, ctx.get_cuda_stream()) };
    value(())
})
.await?;
```

This gives you full access to the CUDA driver API while participating in the `DeviceOperation` model. Everything inside the `unsafe` block is your responsibility to get right.

## Coming from Triton

[Triton](https://triton-lang.org/) and cuTile Rust both let you write kernels in terms of tile-level operations. Many patterns that require explicit warp specialization in Triton (e.g., `warp_specialize` in `tl.range`) are handled implicitly by the cuTile Rust compiler:

| Triton (manual) | cuTile Rust (automatic) |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Assign producer warps to prefetch tiles from global → shared memory | Compiler generates shared memory staging for `load_tile` operations |
| Assign consumer warps to compute on shared memory tiles | Compiler maps tile arithmetic to Tensor Cores and registers |
| Software pipeline with `warp_specialize` in `tl.range` to overlap loads and compute | Compiler uses TMA for hardware-assisted pipelining on supported architectures |
| Manual `tl.dot` placement across warps | `mma()` maps directly to Tensor Core instructions; thread/warp assignment is compiler-managed |
| Tune `num_warps` and `num_stages` for occupancy | `occupancy` and `num_cta_in_cga` optimization hints guide the compiler |

For patterns that don't map to the tile model, compile the kernel with Triton (or write it in CUDA C++) and integrate it via `AsyncKernelLaunch` as described above. Since Triton outputs PTX, you can load it directly:

```rust
let module = load_module_from_ptx(triton_generated_ptx, device_id)?;
let function = Arc::new(module.load_function("gemm_kernel")?);
```
