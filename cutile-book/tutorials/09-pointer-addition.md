# Tutorial 9: Pointer Addition

Sometimes the abstractions provided by cutile are not enough — you need direct control over memory. In this tutorial, we implement vector addition using raw device pointers, and use async to illustrate how things could go wrong.

> **Warning:** Working with raw pointers bypasses cutile's safety guarantees. Use them only when there is no other way to implement a kernel or further improve performance.

use std::future::IntoFuture;

use cutile::tensor::{Tensor, ToHostVec};
use cutile::tile_kernel::TileKernel;

#[cutile::module]

    use cutile::core::*;

    unsafe fn get_tensor<T: ElementType>(ptr: *mut T, len: i32) -> Tensor<T, { [-1] }> {
        let shape: Shape<{ [-1] }> = Shape::<{ [-1] }> { dims: &[len] };
        let strides: Array<{ [-1] }> = Array::<{ [-1] }> { dims: &[1i32] };
        let ptr_tile: PointerTile<*mut T, { [] }> = pointer_to_tile(ptr);
        let tensor = make_tensor_view(ptr_tile, shape, strides, new_token_unordered());
        tensor
    }

    #[cutile::entry()]
    unsafe fn add_ptr<T: ElementType>(z_ptr: *mut T, x_ptr: *mut T, y_ptr: *mut T, len: i32) {
        let mut z_tensor: Tensor<T, { [-1] }> = get_tensor(z_ptr, len);
        let x_tensor: Tensor<T, { [-1] }> = get_tensor(x_ptr, len);

            .store(tile_x + tile_y, [pid.0]);

use my_module::add_ptr;

async fn async_main() -> Result<(), cutile::error::Error> {
    let len = 2usize.pow(5);
    let tile_size = 4usize;

    // Initialize tensors.
    let z: Tensor<f32> = zeros([len]).await?;
    let x: Tensor<f32> = ones([len]).await?;
    let y: Tensor<f32> = ones([len]).await?;

    // Extract device pointers.
    let z_ptr = z.device_pointer();
    let x_ptr = x.device_pointer();
    let y_ptr = y.device_pointer();

    // Prepare kernel launch. Note that, since we're passing in pointers, unsafe is required.
    let op = unsafe { add_ptr(z_ptr, x_ptr, y_ptr, len as i32) }.grid((
        (len / tile_size) as u32,
        1,
        1,
    ));

    // Spawn an asynchronous task to compute this operation.
    let op_handle = tokio::spawn(op.into_future());

    // Note that, while the device operates on these tensors, the programmer is not protected from UB!
    // We do not need the results. Device pointers are Copy (they are copied to device memory).
    let _ = op_handle.await.expect("Failed to execute tokio task.")?;

    let x_host = x.to_host_vec().await?;
    let y_host = y.to_host_vec().await?;
    let z_host = z.to_host_vec().await?;
    for i in 0..z_host.len() {
        let x_i: f32 = x_host[i];
        let y_i: f32 = y_host[i];
        let answer = x_i + y_i;
        println!("{} + {} = {}", x_i, y_i, z_host[i]);
        assert_eq!(answer, z_host[i], "{} != {} ?", answer, z_host[i]);
    }
    Ok(())
}

## How It Works

The helper function `get_tensor` constructs a `Tensor` view from a raw device pointer, a length, and a stride. Because the compiler has no way to verify that the pointer is valid or that the memory it references outlives the kernel, the function — and the kernel entry point — must be marked `unsafe`.

Inside the kernel, the hand-built tensors are partitioned and loaded exactly like their safe counterparts. The only difference is how they were created.

On the host side, `device_pointer()` extracts the raw `*mut T` from an existing tensor. After the kernel completes, the original tensors still own the underlying memory, so we can read back the results with `to_host_vec()`.

---

## The Danger of Async + Raw Pointers

Because `tokio::spawn` is non-blocking, the host code continues executing immediately after the spawn call. If you were to drop or reallocate any of the tensors before the kernel finishes, the kernel would be operating on freed memory — classic undefined behavior. The `await` on the task handle is what ensures the kernel has completed before we proceed.

## Key Takeaways

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **`device_pointer()`** | Extracts a raw `*mut T` from a tensor. |
| **`make_tensor_view`** | Constructs a tensor from a pointer, shape, and strides inside a kernel. |
| **`unsafe` kernels** | Required whenever raw pointers bypass the type system's guarantees. |
| **Lifetime responsibility** | The programmer must ensure pointed-to memory outlives the kernel. |

---

### Exercise 1: Add Bounds Checking

What happens if `len` is not evenly divisible by the tile size? Add a guard in the kernel to handle the remainder.

### Exercise 2: In-Place Scaling

Modify the kernel to scale the output by a constant factor passed as an additional scalar argument.

### Exercise 3: Safe Wrapper

Write a safe Rust wrapper function around the unsafe kernel that validates the pointer lengths at the host level before launching.
